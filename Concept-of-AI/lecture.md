# Concept of AI

A.I. is intelligence demonstrated by machine, unlike the natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals which involve consistence and imotuinality,
A.I. reffers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines, that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions.

The idea characteristic of A.I. is it's ability to rationlize and take actions that have the best chance of achieving a specific goal.
A subset of A.I. is Machine Learning (M.L,) which reffers to the concept that computer programms can automatically learn from and adopt to new data without being assisted by humans.
Deep Learning techniques enable the automatic learning through huge ammount of unstructerd data as text, images or videos.
