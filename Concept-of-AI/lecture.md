# Concept of AI

A.I. is intaligance demosnstrated by machine, unlike the natural intalligance displayed by humans and animals which involve consistence and imotuinality,
A.I. reffers to the simulation of human intalligance in machines, that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions.

The idea charactrstic of A.I. is it's ability to rationlize and take actions that have the best chanxe of achiving a spasific goal.
A subset of A.I. is Machine Learning (M.L,) which reffers to rhe concept that computer programms can automaticly learn from and adopt to new data without being assisted by humans.
Deep Learning techniques enable the automatic learning through huge ammount of unstructerd data as text, images or videos.

>> "The art of creating machines that perform functions that required intalligance when performed by people"
-- _Kucz Weil_, 1980

>> "The study of how to make computer to think at which, at the moment people are better"
-- _Rich amd Knight_, 1991

>> "A field to study that seeks to explain and emulate imtalligamt behaviar in terms of coptutational processes"
-- _Schakoff_, 1990

>> "The branche of computr science that is consent with the automation of inteligance behavier"
-- _Luges and Stubble_, 1993
